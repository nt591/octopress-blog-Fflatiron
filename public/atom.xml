    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Here at the Flatiron School, we&#8217;re building out our own internal feedback tool, which is wonderfully named Feedbackadoro (if you disapprove, please yell at <a href="http://www.twitter.com/aviflombaum">Avi</a>). We started out by building the SQL tables and some practice queries, and I&#8217;m pretty sure I need a lot more work to understand JOINs&#8230;</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Imagine for a moment that you have three tables - one for users of the tool, one for submitted issues, and one for submitted solutions.</p>

<p>Got it?</p>

<p>Great. Now, I had to establish a personal understanding of what the tool would be used for and get into the mindset of the consumer. I felt that, if I were using the tool, I would want to be able to search for questions that were marked as CLOSED and had submitted answers from an instructor of the class. I then wanted to SELECT the name of the user, the content of the issue and the content of the solution</p>

<p>Having to INNER JOIN all three of the tables was tough, I wasn&#8217;t sure if order mattered at first - would I need to join the user table before the solution? It turned out that the mistake I had the entire time wasn&#8217;t a mistake at all! I wrote a query that outputted a blank entry in bash, but I thought it was breaking. Turns out my query was asking for all issues submitted by instructors. My tables didn&#8217;t have that issue at all, why would instructors ask students for help?</p>

<p>Turns out the hardest part of joins isn&#8217;t implementing them, but understanding the question you&#8217;re trying to solve.</p>

<p>Have you had trouble with joins? What kept you up at night?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s day two of class and I&#8217;m already starting to slowly understand (grok?) some of the very core technologies. I have to admit, Git was slightly intimidating when I started but I&#8217;m learning the workflow properly. I&#8217;ve picked up a few rookie tips.</p>

<p>I think if there are three things I would recommend to anyone who wants to start learning how to code, they would be :</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Work with people</strong> - Having people to bounce thoughts and ideas off is easily the best part of this class. Trying to learn on my own was hard, but not impossible. Being around smart and motivated people prevented me from falling behind or getting lazy.</li>
    <li> <strong>Practice a LOT</strong> - This is rather obvious, but the only way to learn how to code is to code. Reading books, watching videos, that&#8217;s all helpful but not the most important thing you can do. It&#8217;s imperative to write crappy code, screw up and learn how to fix it.</li>
    <li> <strong>Customize your environment</strong> - I HATE the standard Mac OS X terminal. All that black-against-white just hurts my eyes. Get it away. Once I tuned the colors and shortcuts to my liking, everything started to fly.</li> 
</ol>
