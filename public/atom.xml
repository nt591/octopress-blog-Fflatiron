    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m incredibly fortunate to be attending the <a href="http://www.flatironschool.com">Flatiron School</a> here in NYC from October through December taking lessons on Ruby, Rails, Javascsript and other web technologies. It&#8217;s been really exciting to try and educate myself about what goes on under the hood on all my favorite web applications. However, not all learning styles work equally well for me.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Typically in college, I&#8217;ve been able to just do practice questions to solidify my understanding. That hasn&#8217;t worked as well when it came to programming languages, particularly in picking up Ruby as a beginner. Luckily there&#8217;s a variety of resources available online and here are some of the tools I&#8217;ve used.</p>

<p>1) <strong>Videos to start</strong> - The best way I&#8217;ve been able to start a new topic is by watching a video on the topic. Some of my favorite resources include <a href="http://www.codeschool.com">Code School</a> and <a href="http://www.treehouse.com">Treehouse</a>. The videos are short and brief, but provide sample questions at the end so you can really drill down and make sure you understand a topic. I will say that I found Code School&#8217;s format to be less like a formal lecture and a little more engaging.</p>

<p>2) <strong>Screencasts are awesome</strong> - Michael Hartl has what is probably the definitive <a href="http://www.ruby.railstutorial.org">Ruby on Rails tutorial</a> available. He makes his book available for free and the screencasts are only $125. Seriously, invest in these and refer to them whenever you get stuck. He&#8217;s a great speaker who can take a complex topic and concisely break it down into baby steps. Plus you can take the PDF on the go like I do and skim topics to review whenever you need to. It&#8217;s awesome.</p>

<p>3) <strong>Looking at code</strong> - Videos, screencasts and books are great but at the end of the day, you&#8217;re not a programmer if you don&#8217;t program. For that, I&#8217;ve been scouring the internet for Rails programmers in fields I&#8217;m interested in and trying to find their Github accounts. It&#8217;s been really helpful to see how people tackle problems, what clean code looks like, and what you&#8217;re capable of doing. A good place to start looking would be open source projects like Octopress (which I use for this blog). PS - if you know of any growth hackers who show off code, <a href="mailto:nikhil@flatironschool.com?Subject=Growth%20Hacker%20Code">email me!</a></p>

<p>How did you learn to code? Can you think of any other resources for a beginner? Finding Ruby was like falling in love, and Carl Sagan once said that when you&#8217;re in love, you want to share it with the world. Let&#8217;s share tips and tricks!</p>

    <id>http://yoursite.com/blog/2012/10/10/sql-joins-are-hard</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Here at the Flatiron School, we&#8217;re building out our own internal feedback tool, which is wonderfully named Feedbackadoro (if you disapprove, please yell at <a href="http://www.twitter.com/aviflombaum">Avi</a>). We started out by building the SQL tables and some practice queries, and I&#8217;m pretty sure I need a lot more work to understand JOINs&#8230;</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Imagine for a moment that you have three tables - one for users of the tool, one for submitted issues, and one for submitted solutions.</p>

<p>Got it?</p>

<p>Great. Now, I had to establish a personal understanding of what the tool would be used for and get into the mindset of the consumer. I felt that, if I were using the tool, I would want to be able to search for questions that were marked as CLOSED and had submitted answers from an instructor of the class. I then wanted to SELECT the name of the user, the content of the issue and the content of the solution</p>

<p>Having to INNER JOIN all three of the tables was tough, I wasn&#8217;t sure if order mattered at first - would I need to join the user table before the solution? It turned out that the mistake I had the entire time wasn&#8217;t a mistake at all! I wrote a query that outputted a blank entry in bash, but I thought it was breaking. Turns out my query was asking for all issues submitted by instructors. My tables didn&#8217;t have that issue at all, why would instructors ask students for help?</p>

<p>Turns out the hardest part of joins isn&#8217;t implementing them, but understanding the question you&#8217;re trying to solve.</p>

<p>Have you had trouble with joins? What kept you up at night?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s day two of class and I&#8217;m already starting to slowly understand (grok?) some of the very core technologies. I have to admit, Git was slightly intimidating when I started but I&#8217;m learning the workflow properly. I&#8217;ve picked up a few rookie tips.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>I think if there are three things I would recommend to anyone who wants to start learning how to code, they would be :</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Work with people</strong> - Having people to bounce thoughts and ideas off is easily the best part of this class. Trying to learn on my own was hard, but not impossible. Being around smart and motivated people prevented me from falling behind or getting lazy.</li>
    <li> <strong>Practice a LOT</strong> - This is rather obvious, but the only way to learn how to code is to code. Reading books, watching videos, that&#8217;s all helpful but not the most important thing you can do. It&#8217;s imperative to write crappy code, screw up and learn how to fix it.</li>
    <li> <strong>Customize your environment</strong> - I HATE the standard Mac OS X terminal. All that black-against-white just hurts my eyes. Get it away. Once I tuned the colors and shortcuts to my liking, everything started to fly.</li> 
</ol>

<p>My money&#8217;s in that office, right? If she start giving me some bullshit about it ain&#8217;t there, and we got to go someplace else and get it, I&#8217;m gonna shoot you in the head then and there. Then I&#8217;m gonna shoot that bitch in the kneecaps, find out where my goddamn money is. She gonna tell me too. Hey, look at me when I&#8217;m talking to you, motherfucker. You listen: we go in there, and that nigga Winston or anybody else is in there, you the first motherfucker to get shot. You understand?</p>

<blockquote><p>Blockquote is what goes
inside this block here
would you believe that
bullshit?</p></blockquote>

<p>Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That show&#8217;s called a pilot. Then they show that show to the people who make shows, and on the strength of that one show they decide if they&#8217;re going to make more shows. Some pilots get picked and become television programs. Some don&#8217;t, become nothing. She starred in one of the ones that became nothing.</p>

<p>The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother&#8217;s keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know My name is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee.</p>

<p>Your bones don&#8217;t break, mine do. That&#8217;s clear. Your cells react to bacteria and viruses differently than mine. You don&#8217;t get sick, I do. That&#8217;s also clear. But for some reason, you and I react the exact same way to water. We swallow it too fast, we choke. We get some in our lungs, we drown. However unreal it may seem, we are connected, you and I. We&#8217;re on the same curve, just on opposite ends.</p>

<p>Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed on it? Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression on his face sitting outside on a mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put quarters in it? No? Well, that&#8217;s what you see at a toy store. And you must think you&#8217;re in a toy store, because you&#8217;re here shopping for an infant named Jeb.</p>
